# Theater-Program
This project is used by a small fictional theater to sell tickets for performances. The theater's auditorium has 15 rows of seats, with 30 seats in each row. A dynamically allocated multidimensional array is used to store the seating chart. The program displays a screen that shows which seats are available and which are taken. Prices are read in through a text file. The user is repeatedly prompted to enter the row number and the seat number for the ticket they want to buy until they decide to quit. When the user quits, the program writes the seating chart, and sales information to their respective files.
